  <p class="estrofe" lang="en">She's got a smile that it seems to me<br>
    Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
    Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky<br>
    Now and then when I see her face<br>
    She takes me away to that special place<br>
    And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry<br></p>
  <p class="refrao" lang="en">Whoa, oh, oh<br>
    Sweet child o' mine<br>
    Whoa, oh, oh, oh<br>
    Sweet love of mine<br></p>
  <p class="estrofe" lang="en">She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
    As if they thought of rain<br>
    I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
    Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br>
    Where as a child I'd hide<br>
    And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by<br></p>
  <p class="refrao" lang="en">Whoa, oh, oh<br>
    Sweet child o' mine<br>
    Whoa whoa, oh, oh, oh<br>
    Sweet love of mine<br></p>
