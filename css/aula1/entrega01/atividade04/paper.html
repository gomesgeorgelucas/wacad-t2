  <p class="titulo" lang="en">CSS-Tutor: An intelligent tutoring system for CSS and HTML</p>
  <p class="autores" lang="en">Alawar, Miriam W.; Abu-Naser, Samy S.</p>
  <p class="resumo" lang="en">Resumo: In this paper we show how a student can learn the basics of the system databases
    using
    (W3school CSS) which was built as intelligent tutoring educational system by using the authoring tool called (ITSB).
    The learning material contains CSS and HTML. We divided the material in a group of lessons for novice learner which
    combines relational system and lessons in the process of learning. The student can learn using example of CSS, and
    types of CSS color. Furthermore, the intelligent tutoring system supports not only lessons; but exercises of
    different difficult levels for each lesson. When a student finish successfully the first difficulty level in a
    lesson, the student is allowed to move to the next difficulty level of the exercises of the lesson.</p>
  <p class="titulo-secao" lang="en">1. Background</p>
  Tutoring systems square measure represented as having 2 loops. The outer one executes once for every task, wherever a
  task typically consists of solving a fancy, multi-step problem. The inner loop executes once for every step taken by
  the student within the resolution of a task. The inner loop will provide feedback and hints on every step. The inner
  loop may assess the studentâ€™s evolving ability and update a student model that is employed by the outer loop to pick
  out a next task that's acceptable for the student. For those that understand very little concerning tutoring systems,
  this description is supposed as a demystifying introduction. For tutoring system consultants, this description
  illustrates that though tutoring systems take issue widely in their task domains, user interfaces, software package
  structures, data bases, etc., their behaviors are in reality quite similar. Human tutoring is widely believed to be
  the foremost effective style of instruction on the world, and experimental work confirms that professional human
  tutors will manufacture very massive learning gains [22, 33]. Ever since computers were fictional, they appeared
  capable of turning into hardworking and economical alternatives to professional human tutors. This dream has evidenced
  troublesome to attain, however vital progress has been created. This focuses totally on intelligent tutoring systems
  (ITS), a very effective instructional technology that began within the late Nineteen Sixties and is simply currently
  rising from laboratories into the sector. Though ITS tutors emphasized their structure (i.e., the software package
  modules and data sources) [33]. Our intelligent tutoring system uses an authoring tool called ITSB to model the domain
  knowledge and generate student models rules. The research presented in this paper is significant because we show that
  ITS can be used to support students learning design tasks. The paper describes the system's architecture and
  functionality. The system observes students' actions and adapts to their knowledge and learning abilities. ITS system
  has been evaluated in the context of genuine teaching activities. We present the results of two evaluation studies
  with students taking CSS courses, which show that ITS is an effective system. The students have interest in the
  system's adaptability and found it a valuable asset to their learning [33]. CSS is a language that designates the
  style of an HTML manuscript; CSS defines how HTML elements should be presented. This intelligent tutoring system will
  teach students CSS from basic to advanced [1, 2]

  A new student account should be made to have a profile where it permits the student to learn course materials and
  answer questions. The profile consists of information related to the student such as last session date, student
  number, student name, current score, overall score, level difficulty, and problem number during the each session. The
  current student score denotes student score for each difficulty level within a lesson. The overall student score
  represents student score for all levels in a lesson.

    In this paper, we have designed an Intelligent Tutoring System called CSS-Tutor for teaching Development CSS and
    HTML by using ITSB authoring tool. The system was designed to facilitate the study of teaching CSS and HTML lessons
    to students and overcome the difficulties they face. CSS-Tutor architecture and requirements of each part in the
    system have been clarified. We conducted an evaluation of the CSS-Tutor by teachers and students and the results
    were more than good.
